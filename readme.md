#Tiny Template
--------------
A tiny template to make your miniapps a little more beautiful. Doesn't require any other files, just drop it right into your project!

#Important!
You shouldn't include the bootstrap from the twitter servers in the final version of your project, since it's prone to change and might screw up your thing. It should be fine if you just need a quick template though. 

I recently added the <a href="http://designmodo.github.io/Flat-UI/">Flat-UI</a> raw.github.com css into the file, so remember: github is not a css, this is for super quick testing only! Download the files for any actual project you plan on doing!
